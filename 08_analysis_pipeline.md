# Step-by-Step Analysis Pipeline

## 1. Preprocessing
- **Demultiplexing**: Assign reads to individual cells using barcodes.
- **Alignment**: Map reads to the reference genome.
- **Quantification**: Count UMIs per gene per cell.

## 2. Quality Control (QC)
- Remove low-quality cells (e.g., high mitochondrial gene content, low gene count).
- Remove genes not expressed in enough cells.

## 3. Normalization & Scaling
- Normalize counts to correct for sequencing depth.
- Log-transform data for downstream analysis.

## 4. Dimensionality Reduction
- Use PCA to reduce noise and identify main axes of variation.
- Visualize with t-SNE or UMAP.

## 5. Clustering & Cell Type Identification
- Cluster cells based on expression profiles.
- Annotate clusters using marker genes.

## 6. Differential Expression Analysis
- Identify genes differentially expressed between clusters or conditions.

## 7. Visualization & Interpretation
- Visualize clusters, marker genes, and trajectories.
- Interpret results in the context of biological questions.
