# Cell-Cell Communication Analysis

Cell-cell communication analysis aims to infer how different cell types interact within a tissue by examining the expression of ligand and receptor pairs in single-cell RNA-seq data. This helps researchers understand signaling networks, tissue organization, immune responses, and disease mechanisms.

## Why is it important?
- Reveals how cells coordinate their functions in complex tissues
- Identifies key signaling pathways and cellular interactions in development, disease, and therapy
- Can uncover novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers

## Common Tools
- **CellPhoneDB**: Statistical framework for inferring cell-cell communication networks using known ligand-receptor interactions.
- **CellChat**: R package for quantitative inference and analysis of intercellular communication networks.
- **NicheNet**: Predicts ligand-target links between interacting cells, integrating gene expression with prior knowledge of signaling and gene regulatory networks.
- **SingleCellSignalR**: R package for analyzing intercellular communication from scRNA-seq data.

## Typical Workflow
1. Annotate cell types or clusters in your data
2. Use a communication analysis tool to infer ligand-receptor interactions between cell types
3. Visualize interaction networks and interpret biological significance
