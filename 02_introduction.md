# Introduction

Single-cell transcriptomics allows researchers to study gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, which averages signals across thousands or millions of cells, scRNA-seq reveals cellular heterogeneity, rare cell types, and dynamic biological processes.

## Why is scRNA-seq Important?

Traditional bulk RNA-seq provides an average gene expression profile across all cells in a sample, masking the diversity and unique roles of individual cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) overcomes this limitation by enabling the analysis of gene expression in thousands to millions of individual cells simultaneously. This technology is important because:

- **Reveals Cellular Heterogeneity:** Identifies distinct cell types and states within complex tissues, including rare or previously unknown populations.
- **Tracks Developmental Trajectories:** Maps how cells change over time during development, disease progression, or response to treatment.
- **Improves Disease Understanding:** Uncovers cellular mechanisms underlying diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, and immune responses.
- **Enables Precision Medicine:** Facilitates the discovery of cell-type-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

scRNA-seq has revolutionized biology and medicine by providing unprecedented insight into the complexity of life at the single-cell level.

## Applications of scRNA-seq

Single-cell RNA sequencing is used in a wide range of biological and medical research, including:

- **Cancer Research:** Dissecting tumor heterogeneity, identifying cancer stem cells, and understanding tumor microenvironments.
- **Immunology:** Profiling immune cell diversity, tracking immune responses, and discovering new immune cell subtypes.
- **Neuroscience:** Mapping brain cell types, studying neural development, and investigating neurological disorders.
- **Developmental Biology:** Tracing cell lineage and differentiation during embryonic development.
- **Regenerative Medicine:** Understanding tissue repair and regeneration at the cellular level.
- **Infectious Diseases:** Studying host-pathogen interactions and immune responses to infection.

These applications demonstrate the versatility and transformative power of scRNA-seq in modern life sciences.
