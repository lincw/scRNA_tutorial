# Essential Tools & Software

Below are some of the most widely used tools and software packages in single-cell RNA-seq analysis, with brief explanations to help you understand their roles:

## Preprocessing & Quantification
- **Cell Ranger** (10x Genomics): A pipeline for processing raw sequencing data from 10x Genomics platforms. Performs demultiplexing, alignment, barcode/UMI counting, and generates gene-cell count matrices.
- **STARsolo**: An extension of the STAR aligner for single-cell data, supporting flexible input formats and quantification.
- **Kallisto | Bustools**: An efficient, lightweight pipeline for pseudoalignment and quantification of scRNA-seq data.
- **Salmon | Alevin**: Fast and accurate quantification of transcript abundance from scRNA-seq data.

## Quality Control & Filtering
- **Seurat** (R): A comprehensive R package for QC, filtering, normalization, clustering, visualization, and downstream analysis.
- **Scanpy** (Python): A scalable Python toolkit for QC, filtering, normalization, clustering, and visualization.
- **Scrublet**: Detects doublets (artificial cell multiplets) in scRNA-seq data.
- **DoubletFinder**: Identifies and removes doublets from scRNA-seq datasets (R package).

## Cluster Annotation

After clustering cells based on their gene expression profiles, researchers assign biological identities (cell types or states) to these clusters. This process is called cluster annotation, and it can be done in several ways:

- **Manual Annotation:**
  - Researchers identify marker genes that are specifically expressed in each cluster and compare them with known cell type markers from the literature or public databases.
  - This approach is often performed using built-in functions in tools like Seurat (R) or Scanpy (Python), which provide lists of differentially expressed genes for each cluster.

- **Automated Annotation Tools:**
  - **SingleR:** Automatically assigns cell types by comparing the transcriptome of each cluster (or cell) to reference datasets of known cell types.
  - **Garnett:** Uses hierarchical marker-based classification for rapid and reproducible annotation.
  - **scCATCH:** Annotates clusters based on known marker genes and tissue-specific information.
  - **CellTypist:** Machine learning-based tool for rapid annotation using large reference datasets.
  - **Azimuth (Seurat extension):** Maps query data onto reference atlases for annotation.

- **Custom Scripts:**
  - Some researchers develop custom scripts for annotation, especially when working with novel cell types, unique organisms, or integrating multiple datasets.

## Downstream Analysis
- **Seurat** (R): Also used for normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, differential expression, and visualization.
- **Scanpy** (Python): Also used for normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, differential expression, and visualization.
- **Monocle**: Infers cell trajectories and pseudotime to study dynamic biological processes.
- **SingleR**: Automated cell type annotation by comparing single-cell transcriptomes to reference datasets.

## Visualization
- **UMAP, t-SNE, PCA**: Algorithms for dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data in 2D/3D space. Implemented in Seurat, Scanpy, and other toolkits.
- **Loupe Cell Browser**: An interactive visualization tool from 10x Genomics for exploring and annotating scRNA-seq data.

These tools form the backbone of most single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipelines. Choice of tool may depend on platform, programming language preference, and specific analysis goals.
